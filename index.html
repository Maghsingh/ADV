        In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his theory of general relativity, having earlier 
        shown that gravity does influence light's motion. Only a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild 
        found a solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the gravitational field of a
        point mass and a spherical mass.[23][24] A few months after Schwarzschild, Johannes Droste, 
        a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave the same solution for the point mass and 
        wrote more extensively about its properties.[25][26] This solution had a peculiar behaviour 
        at what is now called the Schwarzschild radius, where it became singular, meaning that some 
        of the terms in the Einstein equations became infinite. The nature of this surface was not quite
        understood at the time. In 1924, Arthur Eddington showed that the singularity disappeared after a change of 
        coordinates (see Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates), although it took until 1933 for Georges Lema√Ætre to realize 
        that this meant the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was a non-physical coordinate singularity.
        Arthur Eddington did however comment on the possibility of a star with mass compressed to the Schwarzschild 
        radius in a 1926 book, noting that Einstein's theory allows us to rule out overly large densities for visible 
        stars like Betelgeuse because "a star of 250 million km radius could not possibly have so high a density as 
        the Sun. Firstly, the force of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to escape from it, 
        the rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth. Secondly, the red shift of the spectral lines 
        would be so great that the spectrum would be shifted out of existence. Thirdly, the mass would produce so 
        much curvature of the spacetime metric that space would close up around the star, leaving us outside 
        (i.e., nowhere)
