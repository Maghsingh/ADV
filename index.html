        In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his theory of general relativity, having earlier 
        shown that gravity does influence light's motion. Only a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild 
        found a solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the gravitational field of a
        point mass and a spherical mass.[23][24] A few months after Schwarzschild, Johannes Droste, 
        a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave the same solution for the point mass and 
        wrote more extensively about its properties.[25][26] This solution had a peculiar behaviour 
        at what is now called the Schwarzschild radius, where it became singular, meaning that some 
        of the terms in the Einstein equations became infinite. The nature of this surface was not quite
        understood at the time. In 1924, Arthur Eddington showed that the singularity disappeared after a change of 
        coordinates (see Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates), although it took until 1933 for Georges Lema√Ætre to realize 
        that this meant the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was a non-physical coordinate singularity.
        Arthur Eddington did however comment on the possibility of a star with mass compressed to the Schwarzschild 
        radius in a 1926 book, noting that Einstein's theory allows us to rule out overly large densities for visible 
        stars like Betelgeuse because "a star of 250 million km radius could not possibly have so high a density as 
        the Sun. Firstly, the force of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to escape from it, 
        the rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth. Secondly, the red shift of the spectral lines 
        would be so great that the spectrum would be shifted out of existence. Thirdly, the mass would produce so 
        much curvature of the spacetime metric that space would close up around the star, leaving us outside 
        (i.e., nowhere)

        The idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light could not escape
        it has been around for centuries. Most famously, black holes were predicted by Einstein's 
        theory of general relativity, which showed that when a massive star dies, it leaves behind a small, 
        dense remnant core. If the core's mass is more than about three times the mass of the Sun,
        the equations showed, the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole.
        Scientists can't directly observe black holes with telescopes that detect x-rays, 
        light, or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. We can, however, infer the presence 
        of black holes and study them by detecting their effect on other matter nearby. If a black 
        hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter, for example, it will draw matter inward 
        in a process known as accretion. A similar process can occur if a normal star passes close to 
        a black hole. In this case, the black hole can tear the star apart as it pulls it toward itself.
         As the attracted matter accelerates and heats up, it emits x-rays that radiate into space. Recent 
         discoveries offer some tantalizing evidence that black holes have a dramatic influence on the neighborhoods 
         around them - emitting powerful gamma ray bursts, devouring nearby stars, and spurring the growth of new stars 
         in some areas while stalling it in others.

    <p class="a">
        Most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion. 
        (Smaller stars become dense neutron stars, which are not massive enough to trap light.) 
        If the total mass of the star is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun), 
        it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the 
        influence of gravity. However, as the star collapses, a strange thing occurs. 
        As the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the "event horizon," 
        time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away. When the surface 
        reaches the event horizon, time stands still, and the star can collapse no more - it is a 
        frozen collapsing object.

        High-energy collisions
    </h2>
    <p class="b">
        Gravitational collapse is not the only process that could create black holes. In principle, 
        black holes could be formed in high-energy collisions that achieve sufficient density. As of 2002, 
        no such events have been detected, either directly or indirectly as a deficiency of the mass balance 
        in particle accelerator experiments. This suggests that there must be a lower limit for the mass 
        of black holes. Theoretically, this boundary is expected to lie around the Planck mass, where quantum 
        effects are expected to invalidate the predictions of general relativity. This would put the 
        creation of black holes firmly out of reach of any high-energy process occurring on or near the Earth.
        However, certain developments in quantum gravity suggest that the minimum black hole mass could be much
        lower: some braneworld scenarios for example put the boundary as low as 1 TeV/c2. This would make
        it conceivable for micro black holes to be created in the high-energy collisions that occur when cosmic
        rays hit the Earth's atmosphere, or possibly in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. These theories are
        very speculative, and the creation of black holes in these processes is deemed unlikely by many
        specialists. Even if micro black holes could be formed, it is expected that they would evaporate
        in about 10 to 25 seconds, posing no threat to the Earth.

        <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere" target ="_blank"> Photon sphere</a>
    </h2>
    <p class="a">
        The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness in which photons that move on tangents 
        to that sphere would be trapped in a circular orbit about the black hole. For non-rotating black holes, 
        the photon sphere has a radius 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius. Their orbits would be dynamically unstable, 
        hence any small perturbation, such as a particle of infalling matter, would cause an instability that would grow 
        over time, either setting the photon on an outward trajectory causing it to escape the black hole, or on an 
        inward spiral where it would eventually cross the event horizon.
        While light can still escape from the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon sphere on an inbound 
        trajectory will be captured by the black hole. Hence any light that reaches an outside observer from the photon 
        sphere must have been emitted by objects between the photon sphere and the event horizon.[110] For a Kerr black 
        hole the radius of the photon sphere depends on the spin parameter and on the details of the photon orbit, which 
        can be prograde (the photon rotates in the same sense of the black hole spin) or retrograde.
